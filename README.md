<h2>Simple example of Microservices Application using Spring Boot</h2>

This project was created during Santander Bootcamp at Digital Innovation One, 2021.

Feel free to clone, download and run and edit it yourself. You'll need:

* Java 8,
* Docker and Docker Compose,
* An IDE of your choice.

Once you download it, you'll also need Elastic Search and Redis running on your machine. For that, go to the project folder on your terminal/powershell. There you'll find a file named "docker-compose.yml". Simply run:

```shell script
docker-compose up -d 
```

After this step, you can freely run the applications on you IDE.

By default, this project listens on localhost ports: 6379, 8080, 8081, 8082. 8888 and 9200.
